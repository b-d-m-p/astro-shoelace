# Astro Shoelace Starter Kit: Blog

This is Astro's official example blog from [Astro Example Library](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples) with [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) added. 

It contains:

- [Astro Starter Kit: blog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog)
- [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/), a forward-thinking library of web components (soon to be [Web Awesome](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fontawesome/web-awesome))
- Astro's official [view transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorials/add-view-transitions/#extending-the-blog-tutorial-with-view-transitions)
- A Shoelace [custom animation example](https://shoelace.style/getting-started/customizing#animations)

The home page has a few Shoelace components at the top, which you can interact with to see that you set up is working. 

The demo components are:

- sl-button
- sl-tooltip
- sl-dropdown
  - sl-menu
  - sl-menu-item

## Installation


```sh
git clone https://github.com/b-d-m-p/astro-shoelace.git

Clone, add more Shoelace components and have fun!
